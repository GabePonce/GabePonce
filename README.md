Hey, I’m Gabe—a passionate IT Programming student at NSCC - COGS, graduating in May 2025. I’m on a mission to turn my lifelong fascination with technology into a career in software development.

Growing up, I was immersed in technology thanks to my dad, who always had a tech project on the go. From troubleshooting family tech issues to exploring how computers work, I developed a deep love for problem-solving and innovation. This passion led me to pursue software development, where I’ve discovered a particular interest in web development, scripting, and AI.

Here are a few highlights of my journey so far:

Productivity App (Mobile Development Class): Developed a functional prototype using SQLite, state management for user tasks, and productivity timers. This project deepened my understanding of the development lifecycle and reinforced my problem-solving skills.

beCurrent (Capstone Project - WIP): Collaborating with two classmates to build a hangout-organizing web app using React, Firebase (Firestore database), and Firebase Authentication. This project is honing my skills in full-stack development, web deployment and teamwork.

To further explore my interest in AI, I’m currently taking Harvard’s CS50AI course. This self-directed learning is helping me understand the fundamentals of AI and machine learning, and I’m excited to delve deeper into this field as part of my career journey.

I’m eager to continue growing as a developer and contribute to innovative projects.

In this repository you can view a little bit of a portfolio of sorts from me.
